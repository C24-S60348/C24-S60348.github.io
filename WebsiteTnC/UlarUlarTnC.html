<strong>Privacy Policy</strong> 
<p>
  AF1 Productions built the <strong>Ular Ular Pnc</strong> app as a Free game. 
  This SERVICE is provided by AF1 Productions at no cost and is intended for use as is.
</p> 

<p>
  This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, 
  use, and disclosure of information if anyone decides to use our Service.

<p>
  <strong>Ular Ular Pnc</strong> is a fun snake and ladder quiz game with multiplayer support. 
  It does not require a login system, and no personal information is collected.

<p>
  We do not collect personally identifiable information. 
  The app is purely for entertainment and does not ask for account details,

  The app may use third-party services that could collect information used to identify you 
  (for example, Google Play Services). These are only for analytics or store-related functions.

  Multiplayer is handled without requiring personal details — just play with your friends or family.
</p>

<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
<p>
  In case of an error in the app, we may collect data and information

  This may include details like your device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, 
  device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app, 
  the time/date of use, and other statistics.

  We value your trust in using our app. Since we do not store personal data,

  or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
</p> 

<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> 
<p>
  This game can be played by children and families. 
  We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
