  <h1>Privacy Policy — Celik Tafsir</h1>

  <p class="muted">Effective date: October 28, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Celik Tafsir</strong> is an application that allows users to read and browse tafsir content originating from <a href="https://celiktafsir.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">celiktafsir.net</a>. The app is designed to download a surah/page once (on first open) so that the content can be read offline afterwards.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information. The app does not require login, registration, or any personal details (name, email, phone number, etc.).</p>

  <h2>What is stored on your device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Downloaded pages / surah content:</strong> When you open a surah for the first time, the app downloads that page’s HTML content so it can be read later without internet. This content is stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Bookmarks & app settings:</strong> Any bookmarks, reading position, and user preferences are saved locally on the device only.</li>
    <li><strong>Images:</strong> By design the app does not permanently cache all remote images. (Pages are saved primarily as text/HTML for offline reading; image handling may be limited to reduce size.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data sent online</h2>
  <p>The app does not upload personal data to our servers. The only network activity is the initial fetch of the surah/page content from the source website (celiktafsir.net) and any optional update requests to fetch fresh content. No user-identifying data is attached to those requests by the app.</p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>If the app includes third-party libraries or platform services (for example, for crash reporting or optional analytics), those services may collect limited technical information according to their own policies. We do not link that information to any personal identity. If you wish, you can disable optional analytics (if provided) inside the app settings.</p>

  <h2>Local-only policy</h2>
  <p>By default, Celik Tafsir follows a local-only storage policy: downloaded pages and bookmarks remain on your device and are not transmitted to us or to third parties. If you clear the app cache or uninstall the app, the local data will be removed from your device.</p>

  <h2>How to remove stored content</h2>
  <p>You can remove downloaded pages or clear bookmarks from the app’s settings or storage/clear-cache option (if available). Uninstalling the app will also remove locally stored content.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The app does not knowingly collect personal data from children. Since Celik Tafsir operates without login and does not collect personal information, it is generally safe for school-age children to use under parental guidance.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to store content locally on the device securely. However, no method of storage or transmission is completely secure—please keep your device protected and avoid sharing it with others if you wish to keep local data private.</p>

  <h2>Links to other sites</h2>
  <p>Celik Tafsir displays content that originates from celiktafsir.net. Links in the content may point to external websites. We are not responsible for the practices or content of those external sites. Please review their privacy policies separately.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally (for example, to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements). When we do, we will update the “Effective date” at the top of this page. Please review it periodically.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or how your data is handled, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:af1gaming01@gmail.com">af1gaming01@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <p class="muted">Note: This privacy policy is provided for informational purposes and should be reviewed by your legal counsel if you plan to publish the app in app stores that require specific privacy disclosures.</p>
