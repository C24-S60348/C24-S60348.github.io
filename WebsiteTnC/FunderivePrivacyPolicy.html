  <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
  <p>
    AF1 Productions built the <strong>Funderive</strong> app as an educational math game. 
    This SERVICE is provided by AF1 Productions at no cost and is intended for use as is.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, 
    and disclosure of information if anyone decides to use our Service.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
  <p>
    Funderive is primarily an offline educational game focused on improving math skills 
    through quizzes and challenges. Most data — such as progress, scores, and local settings — 
    are stored only on your device and never uploaded or shared.
  </p>

  <p>
    For certain quizzes, the app may send question and answer data online to check 
    results or retrieve new quiz content. This data is transmitted <strong>anonymously</strong> — 
    no personal information such as names, emails, device IDs, or account details are collected 
    or associated with it.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. 
    The limited online communication is used solely to exchange anonymous quiz data 
    and improve the educational experience.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Third-Party Services</strong></p>
  <p>
    Funderive may use trusted third-party services (such as Google Play Services) 
    for analytics or app functionality. These services may collect limited technical 
    information as part of their normal operation, in accordance with their own privacy policies.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
  <p>
    Funderive is designed for educational purposes and can be safely used by children. 
    Since the app does not collect personal data, parents and guardians can be confident 
    that their child’s information remains private.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
  <p>
    We value your trust in using our app. Although we do not collect personal information, 
    any data transmitted (such as quiz content) is handled using reasonable security 
    practices to ensure a safe user experience.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>
    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page 
    periodically for any changes. Updates will be posted on this page.
  </p>

  <p>This policy is effective as of 2025-10-21</p>
