    <p>Habit Multiplayer</p>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 10, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Habit Multiplayer (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. 
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the Habit Multiplayer mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect and store the minimum data necessary for the app to function:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> username and hashed password (we never store your plain text password).</li>
      <li><strong>Friend Connections:</strong> your list of invited friends and accepted friend connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Habit Data:</strong> habit titles, optional URLs, shared notes, and tick history (completion records) between invited members.</li>
      <li><strong>Basic Usage Data:</strong> technical information such as timestamps or app activity logs to improve functionality and reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used solely to provide and improve the Habit Multiplayer experience. Specifically, we use data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate your account and secure access to your data.</li>
      <li>Enable you to create, share, and update habits with your invited friends.</li>
      <li>Synchronize and display shared notes and habit progress among group members.</li>
      <li>Improve app stability, usability, and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal information with any third-party companies for marketing or advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only data that may be visible to others is the content shared within your invited friend groups — such as habit titles, notes, and ticked history — as part of the app’s social collaboration features.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take security seriously. All passwords are hashed before storage and cannot be retrieved in plain text. 
      Data is transmitted using encrypted connections (HTTPS) where available, and stored securely in controlled systems.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Your account data and associated habits are retained as long as your account remains active. 
      You may request account deletion at any time, and all associated personal and habit data will be permanently deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data at any time. 
      You can do this directly within the app or by contacting us at the email address below.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Habit Multiplayer is not designed for children under the age of 13. 
      We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. 
      If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in the app or applicable laws. 
      The updated version will be posted here with the “Last updated” date at the top.
    </p>
