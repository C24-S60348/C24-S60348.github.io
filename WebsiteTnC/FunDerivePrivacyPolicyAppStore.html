  <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
  <p>
    AF1 Productions built the <strong>Funderive</strong> app as an educational math game.
    This iOS version of the app is distributed via the Apple App Store and is intended
    for use as is.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page is used to inform users about our policies regarding the collection, use,
    and disclosure of information for anyone who chooses to use our Service.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
  <p>
    Funderive is primarily an offline educational game focused on improving math skills
    through quizzes and challenges. Most data — such as progress, scores, and local
    settings — are stored only on your device and are never uploaded or shared by us.
  </p>

  <p>
    For certain quizzes, the app may send question and answer data online to check
    results or retrieve new quiz content. This data is transmitted <strong>anonymously</strong> —
    no personal information such as names, emails, device identifiers, or account details
    are collected or associated with it.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information.
    The limited online communication is used solely to exchange anonymous quiz data
    and improve the educational experience.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Third-Party Services</strong></p>
  <p>
    Funderive may use trusted third-party services (for example, Apple services or
    analytics providers) to help us understand app performance or deliver core
    functionality. These services may collect limited technical information as part
    of their normal operation, in accordance with their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any relevant third-party services
    that may be used with this app.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
  <p>
    Funderive is designed for educational purposes and can be safely used by children.
    Since the app does not collect personal data, parents and guardians can be confident
    that their child’s personal information remains private.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
  <p>
    We value your trust in using our app. Although we do not collect personal information,
    any data transmitted (such as quiz content) is handled using reasonable security
    practices to help provide a safe user experience.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>
    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this
    page periodically for any changes. Updates will be posted on this page.
  </p>

  <p>This policy is effective as of 2025-10-21.</p>
